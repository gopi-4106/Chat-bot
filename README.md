# Chat-bot
# Project: Custom AI Chatbot

**Objective:**

The objective of this assignment is to assess your ability to design and develop a chatbot that can generate responses based on a custom dataset. You will be required to train an AI model and deploy it as a simple web application.

**Parts:**

* **Part 1: Setting Up the Environment**
    * Ensure Python is installed on your system.
    * Set up the necessary dependencies to support AI model training and chatbot development.
* **Part 2: Preparing the Custom Dataset**
    * Create a structured dataset in JSON format.
    * The dataset should consist of multiple question-answer pairs.
    * Ensure the dataset covers a variety of topics relevant to the chatbotâ€™s purpose.
* **Part 3: Implementing the Chatbot**
    * Develop a Python script to process and respond to user input.
    * Implement logic to match user input with predefined responses from the dataset.
    * If no predefined response exists, the chatbot should generate an appropriate response.
* **Part 4: Fine-Tuning the AI Model**
    * Train the chatbot model using the prepared dataset.
    * Optimize the model for improved accuracy and performance.
    * Save the trained model for future use.
* **Part 5: Creating a Web Interface**
    * Develop a Flask-based API to handle chatbot interactions.
    * Implement an endpoint to accept user input and return chatbot responses.
