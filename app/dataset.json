  },
  {
    "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
    "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is underfitting in machine learning?",
    "answer": "Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns of the data."
  },
  {
